## intent: ask_advise 
 - my nearly two year old will suddenly decide the toy hes playing with is awful and get [so angry](intensity) with it. instead of going and playing with something else hell just keep [throwing](intensity) said toy whilst [sobbing](intensity) at it. 
 - [didnt want](tantrum reason) pasta even though its her favourite, [threw it](intensity) on the floor on the nice clean carpet and [screamed](intensity) as loud and as long as she could.
 - its just so [hard work](parent sentiment) and i feel like i am just spending my life bribing her or asking her to do something else instead of what she wants to do just to [distract](parent reaction) her 247
 - my 2.5 year old gets agitated [regularly](timing) and now he has dropped his nap (hes not really ready) he gets [more tired](tantrum reason) and [arsey](intensity)  as the day goes on 
 - this time ive found that [ignoring](parent reaction) works. i simply dont have the time to negotiate with them. i [leave them](parent reaction) on the floor to cry, letting them know they can come for a cuddle when theyre ready. 
 - im [at my wits end](parent sentiment) with dd (3). [every morning](timing) on the school run she has a tantrum. it has been going on since september. we take her brother (6) to school. this morning she kicked off as soon as we left the house, [refused](tantrum reason) to walk, [refused](tantrum reason) to be picked up, [hit](intensity) me repeatedly when i tried to move her and in the end [all i could do](parent sentiment) was [push her](parent reaction) (gently) with the palm of my hand to get her to the school gates.
 - yesterday, when he [refused](tantrum reason) to move and lay down on pavement, i pretended to [walk away](parent reaction) as he always follows me (eventually) but i was aware it looked like he was on his own crying and [felt uncomfortable](parent sentiment) with it as [people were looking](parent sentiment) and may not have known i was nearby.
 - i carried her over my shoulder (or under my arm like a football, i cant remember) [to her room](parent reaction), still [screaming](intensity), and now [kicking](intensity), too
 -  so [eventually](length) ive had to [give in](parent reaction) because i get [paranoid](parent sentiment) if the [neighbours can hear](parent sentiment) him its 5am, i mean it was [pure screaming](intensity) to my own ears never mind anyone else. so i undo the gate tell him to head down il be there i was getting his little sister whos now screaming being woken up and yet hes [screaming](intensity) more at me.
 - my son threw the most [ridiculous](intensity) paddy in the gym [car park](setting) today and was hell bent on [throwing himself](intensity) onto the very wet ground. i spent a good 30 seconds [fighting him](parent reaction) to keep him upright and ended up [picking him up](parent reaction) under one arm and marching him into the building.

 - getting him to do anything at all is such [hard work](parent sentiment), he whines, cries, [shouts](intensity), says no, runs away, [cries for daddy](tantrum reason), [wont share](tantrum reason), [pulls my hair](intensity) and [doesnt want to](tantrum reason) do anything other than play trains
 - i generally try to [ignore](parent reaction) the [outburst](intensity), take away the things that he [throws](intensity), and sit quietly near him, and be ready to [hold him](parent reaction) when he starts calming down a little bit
 - about five minutes after waking up (its the same whether i wake him or let him wake up by himself) he starts crying and [screaming](intensity) and nothing i do seems to make it any better. 
 - my son has turned into another child in a matter of a few weeks and we are [not sure](parent sentiment) if it is us, the situation, [natural changes](tantrum reason), or if there is anything we can do about it.
 - when [he wakes](tantrum reason) up from a daytime nap hes often [hysterical](intensity) and [inconsolable](intensity). 
 - he will have a [full blown](intensity) [rage](intensity) at the smallest thing. yesterday he cried and [screamed](intensity) for nearly [20 minutes](length) because i was speaking on the phone
 - he is so fussy if things [dont go his way](tantrum reason), to the point where it can become [screaming](intensity). [sharing](tantrum reason) with other kids is a big problems as well. anyone going through this stage [i feel so tired](parent sentiment) sometimes. i try to keep calm always and let him know its okay to share, and he can play with other things etc, i [acknowledge his feelings](parent reaction) as well. 
 - her [rage](intensity) is [uncontrollable](intensity). she [thrashes](intensity), [kicks](intensity), [bites](intensity) her own hand or me, [pulls her hair](intensity) and face and [throws herself](intensity) around the floor [banging her head](intensity) on the floor. if i try to [hold her](parent reaction) it makes the rage worse and she [hits](intensity) and [bites](intensity) me. if i try to [talk to her](parent reaction) she [screams](intensity) no and the rage increases. sometimes its for [5 mins](length) but yesterday one lasted for [25 mins](length) and i had to ring my friend to collect my son from school as i was scared to leave the house
 - had a [huge tantrum](intensity) earlier because her grandad wouldnt pass her the salt pot off te table hmm.

 - she [refuses](tantrum reason) to get out of her car seat. after much cajoling, negotiation and hell, even [bribery](parent reaction), she was still refusing. i ended up lifting her out of the car and carrying her indoors [screaming](intensity). that was [50 minutes](length) ago and it continues. not just a whinge but [full on](intensity), force ten screaming.  i am not sure where she gets the [energy](parent sentiment). 
 - this means its very difficult to pick her up so i just sit on the ground trying my best to [cradle her head](parent reaction) in my lap while she freaks out so she doesnt hurt herself 
 -  he wouldnt talk, couldnt be distracted, didnt take the offered snack, wouldnt play with a toy, just [screamed and screamed](intensity) until he [fell onto the floor](intensity) and started [pounding it](intensity). 
 - oh god my toddler has nearly [destroyed me](parent sentiment) today. for a large part of the day hes been fine then he turns into an absolute [nightmare](parent sentiment), [screaming](intensity) at me, [head butting](intensity) me, telling me to ssshhh. the neighbours heard his [melt down](intensity).
 - he has [recently](timing) started[ banging](intensity) his head against the high chair, so hard the chair starts moving across the kitchen floor.
this [tends](timing) to happen more towards in the evening, so i realise hes probably [tired](tantrum reason) after his day at the nursery.

 - so i have to hold this [screaming](intensity) and tantruming 2 yr old. i think about going to the car, but id have to carry him and somehow get the bike and oh yeah my back is friggin killing me and hes [kicking](intensity) and [punching](intensity) my stomach.
 -  i did my research on this subreddit and talked to his daycare teachers, and have decided the best way to respond to this (either doing [nice touch](parent reaction) with him, or sternly telling him no, [without reacting](parent reaction) a lot to his hitting).
 - he switches like jackal and hyde he be all nice then bang he gets [so angry](intensity) for nothing most the time hes started [hitting himself](intensity) really hard he will smack his little head off things it takes at least [20 mins](length) to [calm him](parent reaction) down each time its so [draining](parent sentiment) most the time
 - she will [bang her head](intense) on the wall, floor, or us. she also will [hit](intensity). she is not swatted or spanked and doesnt see anyone banging their head, so i am not sure where she is getting this from. she will also [scream](intensity) at the top of her lungs. if you try to [comfort](parent reaction) her or [settle](parent reaction) her down it makes it worse. when she starts [banging her head](intensity) we [pick her up](parent reaction) so she doesnt hurt herself. 
 - [most nights](timing) he [wakens](tantrum reason) and crys, we give him aroun 34 mins to [see if he will settle](parent reaction) but never has.
he will be sitting up in bed, [screaming](intensity) and [reaching out](tantrum reason) for us, we try to [lie him](parent reaction) back down but hes straight back up, [throws](intensity) his teddys across the room along with his dummy, we have tried to [sit it out](parent reaction), one night taking [1hr 10mins](length). we [cant understand](parent sentiment) why he was doing this.
 - we were in a [shop](setting) yesterday and i told him he could choose a toy but he was [insistent](tantrum reason) that [he wanted](tantrum reason) 2. i told him firmly that he could only have one but he dug his heels is and [persisted](tantrum reason) until i [carried him](parent reaction) out of the shop [screaming](intensity) after hed knocked the whole display over.
 - i am an [emotional wreck](parent sentiment) right now. my 2 year old is [slapping](intensity) me in the face [everyday](timing), [screaming](intensity) at me,  telling me [no](tantrum reason) at basically anything i ask him to do. every time he [hits](intensity) me it [breaks me](parent sentiment) even though i know it shouldnt. 
 - problem is [road](setting) has lots of potholes and ds gets distracted, wants to jump in the puddles etc, so if he starts messing i literally have to drag him [off the road](tantrum reason) resulting in a tantrum on the corner of a busy junction. i have newborn ds2 in sling so find myself [desperately](parent sentiment) [negotiatingbribing](parent reaction) ds1 to calm down, especially [difficult](parent sentiment) when its heavy rain so more puddles and [more temptation](parent reaction) around.
 - fortunately she doesnt do anything like spit or hit. but she [screams](intensity), [throws](intensity) herself to the ground, [goes limp](intensity) while holding my hand etc.
 - the only way we can get her to stop is by [distracting](parent reaction) her with the [tv](parent reaction). but i [dont feel like](parent sentiment) thats the right answer, and im [worried](parent sentiment) that shes just bottling things up when we do that.
 - she had a paddy tonight and so i put her on [the step](parent reaction) and then eventually to bed, because she [refused](tantrum reason) to go to the step so had to be [manhandled](parent reaction) there and then proceeded to [shout](intensity) and [roar](intensity) at me from the step.
 - my 2 year old will [scream](intensity), at the [top of her lungs](intensity), over and over, for the smallest reasons and she just will not stop
 - my son is 3 in august and i feel like the [terrible twos](intensity) are [getting worse](intensity) like he has a really [bad attitude](intensity) when something doesnt go [his way](tantrum reason) 

 - [aggressive](intensity) outbursts
 - lots of [changes](tantrum reason) have occurred [lately](timing) 
 -  he was like an [alligator on meth](intensity), [flailing](intensity), [death rolling](intensity), and [screaming](intensity)
 - [sharing emotions](parent reaction) and not [hitting](intensity) 
 -  i just dont know what else to do but [have a cry](parent sentiment) when we get home

 - mine came up behind me yesterday and bit the back of my leg and when i turned around and [said no](tantrum reason) she had a [full meltdown](intensity). [threw herself](intensity) on the floor [sobbing](intensity).
 - im starting to [dread spending time](parent sentiment) with him and having a [hard time](parent sentiment) dealing with it [emotionally](parent sentiment). its starting to make me [cry a lot](parent sentiment) 
 - this is accompanied by [kicking](intensity), [noodle arms](intensity) if you try and pick her up and [paralyzed legs](intensity) that dont work if you try and stand her upright 
 - i cant see any external triggerthey seem to come out of some sort of [inner frustration](tantrum reason) 
 - but im [weary](parent sentiment) at the ens of eaxh day and i dread [nappy changes](tantrum reason). or [asking her](tantrum reason) to take her coat off. or needing to [take something from her](tantrum reason) that could cause harm. she can [freak](intensity) over anything and its so, so [draining](parent sentiment).
 - ive tried [ignoring](parent reaction) him, [cuddling](parent reaction) him, [raising my voice](parent reaction), [offering food](parent reaction), [distracting](parent reaction) with toystvpointing out the window and [nothing works](parent sentiment). they just keep going and he gets more distressed.
 - anyway, one day i went to pick her up and she didnt want to come home. grabbed her hand and dragged her out of the centre while she [screamed](intensity) the whole way. when i got her to the car she would not sit in her car seat  basically went [stiff as a board](intensity), [arms flat](intensity) to her sides, legs straight out.
 - we can have a nice day at the park or swimming or soft play and as soon as [we start to leave](tantrum reason) she starts the [screaming](intensity) and lying down and wont move. i dont even have the strength to lift her sometimes coz she hits out and its hard to hold while dodging the [blows](intensity). this can last for about [45mins](length) at times.
 - ds has had the odd occasion over the [last few months](timing) of [not wanting](tantrum reason) a nappy change or to put his trousers or top on but in the last week it has been [every day](timing) and not just [refusing](tantrum reason) but having [massive](intensity) tantrums
 - my 15 month old has [awful tantrums](intensity), when he doesnt get his [own way](tantrum reason) he [hits me](intensity) or [throws toys](intensity) at me and dh. i have tried to [ignore](parent reaction) this behaviour but it seems to make matters worse.

 - for the [past month](timing) she has been waking 5,6,7 times in the night at least [screaming](intensity) (i want my teddy, i want water etc) and is [demanding](tantrum reason) things through the day and if we dont have it she has a full blown tantrum. 
 - ive gotten [death glares](parent sentiment) from grandparents and [stares](parent sentiment) from others
 - so my little girl is 4 years old and has [explosive](intensity) tantrums. the other day i asked dd (dear daughter) to clean up her toys as im trying to teach her some responsibility. she flat out said  i cant do it i said  lets not talk like that, yes you can if you try here mommy will help you by then she started [throwing](intensity) her toys, [screaming](intensity) and even flipped her mattress off her little toddler bed. i just stood there [horrified](parent sentiment) watching her [destructive](intensity) behavior, i mean if you could call it that. i didnt know what to do other than [grab her](parent reaction) and [bear hug](parent reaction) her before she hurt herself and while she was [kicking](intensity) and [screaming](intensity) i just continued to [rock her](parent reaction) and kept telling her to [calm down](parent reaction). 
 - i just try and talk to him and say you have to have patience [be calm](parent reaction), and after awhile he starts to calm down and gets it otherwise when i [give him what he wants](parent reaction) hell [throw it](intensity) on the floor
 - he has a very [short temper](intensity) and [lashes out](intensity) [hitting](intensity) myself and others during tantrums and has recently began [screaming as loud](intensity) as he can during these tantrums. how can i quickly help him to [regulate these emotions](parent reaction) and acts of frustration and anger without being angry myself
 - [anger](intensity) management 
 - i decided last night to take a stand and treat it as naughty behaviour, so [put him in the corner](parent reaction) for 2 minute intervals. i have the most stubborn child in the world and of course it got me nowhere. after [40 minutes](length) i needed to feed ds2 so just put ds1 in a headlock and got on with it. but it was like a physical fight and [i felt awful](parent sentiment), like i was assaulting him.
 - [listening to her](parent reaction) and repeating back what shes saying to show were listening  she only [screams more](intensity)
