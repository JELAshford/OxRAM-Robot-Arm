## intent: ask_advise 
 - I feel like a [bad parent] (parent sentiment) if I am not picking him up every single second, but at the same time....I know he has to get used to frustration so I sorta of just ["ignore it"] (parent reaction). Sometimes he'll [throw a fit] (intensity) and won't even let me touch him but once he's kinda gotten over it he'll come back and lay his head on my knee or something
 - Our family life is [miserable] (parent sentiment)
 - [Ignoring] (parent reaction) her and waiting for her to stop - She [never stops] (parent sentiment), she only [screams more] (intensity)
 - My wife and I are pretty consistent with discipline and handle tantrums [calmly] (parent reaction) and mostly sternly until they are over. We [never give into] (parent reaction) what she wants
 - if [he wants] (tantrum reason) to walk in a certain direction and we stop him he just [lies down] (intensity). when we try to put him back in his buggy he goes [nuts] (intensity)! i'm [sick of it] (parent sentiment) already and it's only been a few days!!

 - Every once in a while, taking him into a [different room] (parent reaction) can reset things, but usually once it starts, it continues to a [full-blown] (intensity) tantrum--[stamping] (intensity) and [kicking] (intensity) and [throwing himself] (intensity) on the floor and [hitting his head] (intensity) 
 - Now, seemingly out of nowhere, she will decide that she ["needs" something] (tantrum reason). So she will go straight to full tantrum [meltdown mode] (intensity) and start [screaming] (intensity) "I NEED <insert thing here>!!!!" Over and over and over, while [crying] (intensity), [hitting furniture] (intensity), [growling] (intensity), and [trying to breathe] (intensity).
 - She's [just hit the age] (timing) where she starts timing throwing tantrums
 - My son started [screaming] (intensity) at the [top of his lungs] (intensity)
 - He never wants clothes on but then at the end of the day it's [the same] (timing) [screaming] (intensity) when we have to take them off
 -  He wouldn't talk, couldn't be distracted, didn't take the offered snack, wouldn't play with a toy, just [screamed and screamed] (intensity) until he [fell onto the floor] (intensity) and started [pounding it] (intensity). 
 - 21 month dd, she [throws herself on the floor] (intensity), [headbutts the door] (intensity) [throws things] (intensity) and [slaps] (intensity) us! 
 - Tantrums 
 - Timeouts - She only [screams more] (intensity)
 - It [causes fights] (parent/family involvement) between my husband and I, and we hardly ever fight--especially over parenting 
 - We’re currently potty training and there was a day when he didn’t wanna go potty so every time he had [to pee] (tantrum reason) he got stressed out. This resulted in multiple tantrums.
 - A [few days ago] (timing), he started [hitting] (intensity) when I would take something away from him that [he wanted] (tantrum reason). 
 - So this morning he’s [screaming hysterically] (intensity) to then go [downstairs] (setting), obviously I [don’t know if] (parent sentiment) I’ve done the right thing to [ignore him] (parent reaction) and [not arise to] (parent reaction) his behaviour but then I can see it’s [infuriating him] (intensity) a two year old [screaming] (intensity) on top of [his lungs] (intensity), then starts [hitting] (intensity), [scramming me] (intensity) even [hitting] me (intensity) to the face
 - I have a 2.5 year old daughter who's been going through an [emotional roller coaster] (intensity) the last couple of [months] (timing).
 - But [over there] (family/ parent involvement) he gets waffles, chocolate milk, juice, treats, toys, presents, and no discipline. 
 - She tends to not listen to what we say to her and can be very [emotionally demanding] (parent sentiment) and a bit of a [rollercoaster] (intensity)
 - My kid will [scream and cry] (intensity) and [hit] (intensity), it’s a [nightmare] (intensity). I’ve tried talking to her and telling her that if she’s feeling frustrated or just upset overall to tell us but to [use her words] (parent reaction). I’ve tried doing [timeouts] (parent reaction) and it [doesn’t work] (parent sentiment). Whatever I try to do just doesn’t seem to work and it’s [exhausting] (parent sentiment) :( 
 - We (think) we have tried everything – [Holding] (parent reaction), [reassuring] (parent reaction), [surprising] (parent reaction), moving her into [different surroundings] (parent reaction), using [TV/music/singing] (parent reaction).

 - He immediately started [screaming bloody murder] (intensity) the second I grabbed his hand to start walking and [went limp] (intensity) every time I tried to walk with him. I tried to make it a game a said “come on, let’s race!,” but it wasn’t enough. 

 - I am at the end of [my tether] (parent sentiment) and [don't know] (parent sentiment) how to manage my 26month old boy. He is a [nightmare] (intensity)! From the minute he wakes up everything is a [challenge] (intensity). He [screams] (intensity), [kicks] (intensity), [hits] (intensity) us and sister. 
 - I'm starting to [dread spending time] (parent sentiment) with him and having a [hard time] (parent sentiment) dealing with it [emotionally] (parent sentiment). It's starting to make me [cry a lot] (parent sentiment) 
 - He has a very [short temper] (intensity) and [lashes out] (intensity) [hitting] (intensity) myself and others during tantrums and has recently began [screaming as loud] (intensity) as he can during these tantrums. How can I quickly help him to [regulate these emotions] (parent reaction) and acts of frustration and anger without being angry myself?
 - Or if it’s really bad because he is tired, I just put him down for [a nap].
 - I feel really uncomfortable with [confiscating toys](parent reaction)/[naughty step] (parent reaction) /[behaviour charts] (parent reaction) etc but need to have some way to respond. My husband thinks there needs to be some [punishment] (parent reaction) like being [sent to room] (parent reaction) or [corner] (parent reaction) or having [toys taken] (parent reaction). But I really don't want to do this - I'd prefer a negative consequence than a punishment if you see what I mean. So we're trying to work out what to do.
 - I've gotten [death glares] (parent sentiment) from grandparents and [stares] (parent sentiment) from others
 - 
[Everytime] (timing) we take her to [people's houses] (setting) [she wants] (tantrum reason) to go out side and has a [big strop] (intensity) when it's time to come in or [when she can't] (tantrum reason) go through people's kitchen cupboards or up their stairs etc
 - We've been taking her [to her room] (parent reaction) until she calms down, but it typically takes a good [30 min] (length) of her [screaming] (intensity) with my husband in the room with her until she's done
 - The only way we can get her to stop is by [distracting] (parent reaction) her with the [TV] (parent reaction). But I [don't feel like] (parent sentiment) that's the right answer, and I'm [worried] (parent sentiment) that she's just bottling things up when we do that.
 -  It spirals downward from there. He starts [throwing things] (intensity), repeatedly [yelling "No!"] (intensity)
 - My 19 month old daughter is having [daily tantrums] (timing), sometimes [multiple tantrums] (intensity) in one day. 
 -  I just don't know what else to do but [have a cry] (parent sentiment) when we get home

 - My 20 month old daughter has [recently] (timing) taken to throwing tantrums for everything!
 - Can't help but feel terribly [judged] (parent sentiment) by all the parents there. 
 - Us [not accepting him] (tantrum reason) "feeding us" (He likes to feed us stuff he doesn't want to eat, which is right now basically everything but PBJ's). We'll take a few bites sometimes because it's sweet but sometimes we have to say "no now it's your turn to eat"
 - [Listening to her] (parent reaction) and repeating back what she's saying to show we're listening - She only [screams more] (intensity)
 - Most of the time the things she's asking for are things that we would have no problem giving her if she just asked for them. But she jumps straight into [meltdown mode] (intensity), and we can't really give her what [she wants] (tantrum reason) when she's acting like that.
 - So I have to hold this [screaming] (intensity) and tantruming 2 yr old. I think about going to the car, but I’d have to carry him and somehow get the bike and oh yeah my back is friggin killing me and he’s [kicking] (intensity) and [punching] (intensity) my stomach.
 - I give her a few chances to [calm down] (parent reaction) so we can stay and play but I tell her we can only stay if she behaves
 -  She's a very [intense] (intensity) little person, [loud and corky] (intensity)

 - It just [seems endless] (parent sentiment). [She won't] (tantrum reason) hold my hand so basically if we go in a [shop] (setting) I have to pick her up and endure [screaming] (intensity) or else she just [trashes the place] (intensity)!
 - He’ll do it occasionally during the day when things go wrong for him. not really if he doesn’t [get his way] (tantrum reason), he has to be really offended. But if he [snaps] (intensity), he’s a [maniac] (intensity). I’ve tried [holding] (parent reaction) time: I just hold him in a tight hug so he can‘t go anywhere, and [cuddle] (parent reaction) him. This does seem to work but it takes 10 minutes or so

 - It has been [weeks] and there have been very little changes. 
 - When upset or tired, he constantly [smacks] (intensity) my husband & me. We can stick him in [time out] (parent reaction), [pick him up] (parent reaction), and he immediately does it again. It's obvious he's doing it because he's [crabby] (tantrum reason) & we are all trying to help him talk/work through his [emotions] (parent reaction) in a better way.
 - [I read] (parent sentiment) we are supposed to be [comforting] (parent reaction) him but he won’t let us. Beyond being [physically violent] (intensity), he [yells] (intensity) at us to leave and that he wants us to be sad. If we do offer to leave or go to leave he yells at us for that to. If we try and [be passive] (parent reaction) and not acknowledge what he’s currently screaming about then he yells at us to talk. If we talk to him he yells at us not to talk

 -  He was like an [alligator on meth] (intensity), [flailing] (intensity), [death rolling] (intensity), and [screaming] (intensity)
 - Fortunately she doesn't do anything like spit or hit. But she [screams] (intensity), [throws] (intensity) herself to the ground, [goes limp] (intensity) while holding my hand etc.
 - I [can’t cope] (parent sentiment) with her behaviour
 - Anyway, one day I went to pick her up and she didn't want to come home. Grabbed her hand and dragged her out of the centre while she [screamed] (intensity) the whole way. When I got her to the car she would not sit in her car seat - basically went [stiff as a board] (intensity), [arms flat] (intensity) to her sides, legs straight out.
 - At their worst, he [clinches his fists] (intensity) and [grits his teeth] (intensity) and [shakes] (intensity) and has a look of [sheer rage] (intensity) on his face

 - DD aged just 4yrs has been having about [3 months] (timing) of tantrums. It has been exceedingly [draining] (parent sentiment) and there have been times that I have felt like [crying] (parent sentiment) - her mood never reflects the fun she has just had and she is constantly saying 'No one likes me anymore' or 'You don't like me'.
 - [Aggressive] (intensity) outbursts
 - He's had tantrums for a [few months] (timing) now, but they are increasing in frequency.
 -  So [eventually] (length) I’ve had to [give in] (parent reaction) because I get [paranoid] (parent sentiment) if the [neighbours can hear] (parent sentiment) him it’s 5am, I mean it was [pure screaming] (intensity) to my own ears never mind anyone else. So I undo the gate tell him to head down il be there I was getting his little sister who’s now screaming being woken up and yet he’s [screaming] (intensity) more at me.
 -  Everything was great until he noticed that the kitchen floor is - surprise - not made of sand which means he can’t dig in it. He [fucking lost it] (intensity). Nothing I did calmed him down, he was [hammering the shovel] (intensity) on the tiles screaming for sand
 - We get to the [gallery] (setting) and kid gets a snack and I think we're golden but no, he's [ravenous as fuck] (tantrum reason) and we sit down [to eat] (tantrum reason) but they largely ignore us and then Kid just [SNAPS] (intensity), minutes after we order
 - If Mommy puts him to bed, he will try to [cry and whine] (intensity) [for Daddy] (tantrum reason) to sing him songs, part of our [bedtime] (setting) routine, after he goes down. It's [constant] (timing)

 - If you didn't see us at [the park] (setting), you could follow the trail of [screams] (intensity)  and find us. 
 - So whenever something sets her off she's a literal [drama queen] (intensity)
 - This is accompanied by [kicking] (intensity), [noodle arms] (intensity) if you try and pick her up and ["paralyzed" legs] (intensity) that don't work if you try and stand her upright 
 - I try to hold my ground, but sometimes just a simple trip to the [grocery store] (setting) can end up being very [long and tiresome] (parent sentiment).
 - We were at a [bookshop] (setting) and they had a little cave set up for the kids with books and toys. We had to leave and my then2 y\o obviously [didn’t want to] (tantrum reason). I had to carry a [screaming and kicking] (intensity) child through the city and he just [kept on and on] (length)
 - my son is 3 in August and i feel like the [terrible twos] (intensity) are [getting worse] (intensity) like he has a really [bad attitude] (intensity) when something doesn't go [his way] (tantrum reason) 

 -  It was the end of my son's [bath] (setting) (he likes baths), so I took him out of the tub and brought him into his room, where he proceed to have a [meltdown] (intensity)

 - We [can't enjoy him] (parent sentiment), and we now have [no time] (parent sentiment) or opportunity to enjoy each other 
 - But I did have to leave an indoor [playground] (setting) after he was giving me a [hard time] (intensity) and being [aggressive] (intensity) to other kids. But that was an [epic meltdown] (intensity)/time-out that I can remember
 - [Anger] (intensity)
 - To deal with her [emotions] (parent reaction) a little better
 - My toddler’s tantrums ended with him going silent, [pale and glassy eyed] (intense)  like he’d had a [seizure] (intensity). It was very [unnerving] (parent sentiment)
 -  She’s recently become completely enamored with bubbles, and of course today (with mom traveling) she wanted to hold the container so she could [do it herself] (tantrum reason). Of course it ended up all over her and as I took her up to bathe her she had a [total meltdown] (intensity)
 - Behaviour
 - i feel like im suppose to be the child , iv tried to [be calm] (parent reaction) and [say 'no'] (parent reaction) and put him in [time out] (parent reaction) but its really [mentally draining] (parent sentiment) for me with all thee things that i have going on with my [mental health (ptsd)] (parent sentiment) 
 - twelve month old who has incredibly [aggressive] (intensity), [prolonged] (length) tantrums, up to [ten/twelve times a day] (timing)
 - I'm starting to feel that he is a [ticking time bomb] (intensity) that I [don't know] (parent sentiment) how to diffuse
 - It’s almost like she just gets [angry/frustrated] (tantrum reason) about something and just completely [loses it] (intensity). Then once it’s over, she’s fine and smiling
 - Don’t get me wrong he has a lovely side to him too but, now this morning he’s [woke] (private) at 5am, he didn’t fall asleep until 11pm last night, [screaming] (intensity) [for daddy] (tantrum reason), my partner is on nights and he’s been doing this for [8 months] (timing) now so it’s not something new
 - I am an [emotional wreck] (parent sentiment) right now. My 2 year old is [slapping] (intensity) me in the face [everyday] (timing), [screaming] (intensity) at me, & telling me [no] (tantrum reason) at basically anything I ask him to do. Every time he [hits] (intensity) me it [breaks me] (parent sentiment) even though I know it shouldn’t. 
 - I'm [unsure] (parent sentiment) if she understands me since she's pretty non- verbal.
 - By 'tantrum' I mean, one thing gets her going and then 15 minutes later she's [rolling on the ground] (intensity) and [screaming] (intensity) like she needs in [exorcism] (intensity)
 - I've been [calmly] (parent reaction) trying to talk to her and [offer hugs] (parent reaction) but she doesn't want them. She tries to hand me a book or toy and I go to grab it and she rips it away and continues [screaming] (intensity) even louder than before. This one that just ended went on for [~20 minutes] (length).
 -  Started wondering maybe [daddy gives into] (family/partner involvement) everything and just finding that level to be consistent and [not give in] (parent reaction) for an easy ride!
 - The son, 3 in a week, has [violent](intensity) tantrums and has to be brought to [his room] (parent reaction). We stay in there [with him] (parent reaction) but often have to move him to his bed and try to get him to stay there. He [hits] (intensity), [bites] (intensity), [scratches] (intensity), and will [throw anything] (intensity) in his room he can get his hands on
 - Tantrums [when losing] (tantrum reason)
 - Yesterday I’ve had a plate [thrown](Intensity) at my face, he has a [tendency](Timing) to [throw](Intensity) stuff a lot [nowadays](Timing) and always responds with no.
 - I can't see any external trigger--they seem to come out of some sort of [inner frustration] (tantrum reason) 
 - Other kids were also playing and he got upset that they were encroaching upon his doors. I told him to calm down or we would leave, which made him more upset. I picked him up and he started [screaming]. 
 - Sometimes his tantrums start because of a clearly identified reason, like he can't have something that [he wants] (tantrum reason). But it seems like most of the time, they come [out of nowhere] (tantrum reason)

 - There were [tears] (intensity). There was [yelling] (intensity). There was [waving of arms] (intensity) and being an absolute [shithead] (intensity). 
 - Now, everything is a [battle] (intensity) between US, because each of us has our [own method] (parent/family involvement) 
of dealing with him.
 - It has escalated to the point where [daddy has to] (tantrum reason) be the one to change the diaper, [daddy's the one] (tantrum reason) that can soothe the boo boo etc. If I try to do it myself, or even come close, she would throw a tantrum, and even become [violent] (intensity) towards me
 - Lots of [changes] (tantrum reason) have occurred [lately] (timing) 
 - The boy is a really fun and sweet kid, but he’s developing some kind of [extreme tantrums] (intensity) and maybe [separation anxiety] (tantrum reason) or something like that - no diagnosis yet - and we’re [not sure what to do] (parent sentiment)

 -  I think they were pretty surprised by the [intensity] (intensity) of it
 - She has a tantrum when it's time to get dressed or put shoes on. Tantrum when I brush her teeth, tantrum at coming out the bath, it's just [non stop] (timing)
 - He's generally well-behaved at daycare, but he just threw his first [full-blown tantrum] (intensity) at daycare this [last week] (timing) 
 - It's gotten to the point now where we just have to [lock him] (parent reaction) in his room and let him [scream] (intensity) for [10 minutes] (length) before he can be reasoned with or anything in the [house] (setting)
 can continue
 - I'd like tips to [calm her down] (parent reaction) 
 - My almost 2 year old is in the [slapping] (intensity) and [punching] (intensity) phase. It's so bad that hes given me 4 [bloody noses] (intensity) and a [black eye] (intensity) in the past [6 months] (timing). My pediatrician tells me it's a phase but man its [rough] (parent sentiment)

 - I generally try to [ignore] (parent reaction) the [outburst] (intensity), take away the things that he [throws] (intensity), and sit quietly near him, and be ready to [hold him] (parent reaction) when he starts calming down a little bit
 - had a [huge tantrum] (intensity) earlier because her Grandad wouldn't pass her the salt pot off te table hmm.

 - The most concerning is when I leave for work. These days I’m working half the time in the basement office, the other half out of the house. If he [doesn’t get] (tantrum reason) a hug and a kiss before I go, he [loses his mind] (intensity). He;’s been out on the back porch for [15 minutes screaming] (length)
 - I do my best to tell her "we can't climb on the rope bridge right now but [we CAN] (parent reaction) play in the sand, climb on rocks or go down the slide!"
 - My 15 month old has [awful tantrums] (intensity), when he doesn't get his [own way] (tantrum reason) he [hits me] (intensity) or [throws toys] (intensity) at me and dh. I have tried to [ignore] (parent reaction) this behaviour but it seems to make matters worse.

 - My two year old has become difficult to handle, he has a temper and [smacks](Intensity), [scrams](Intensity) me, [yanks](Intensity) me quite a lot more when he cannot get his own way.
 - Yesterday I locked myself in our bedroom for an hour because I [couldn't take it anymore] (parent sentiment) 
 - Our daughter turned 2 in February and she has [recently] (timing) started having [horrible tantrums] (intensity). They are much more [intense] (intensity), [screaming](intensity), [kicking] (intensity), [crying] (intensity), and [longer, 1/2 hr - 1 hour], (length) than what we experienced with our 5 year old son
 - Well he [FLIPPED OUT] (intensity). [Screamed] (intensity) like a [maniac] (intensity), got on his bike and started biking as fast as he could—like I said—near a [pond] (setting)

 - I am wanting to help build my child's ability to deal with [frustration] (tantrum reason). She tends to immediately get upset when something is difficult for her to do.
 - People stood and [stared] (parent sentiment), mouths open. We got to the car and I couldn’t get him in the car seat because he was [fighting me] (intensity) so we sat in the car for 15 minutes until he calmed down
 - His behaviour 
 - By some miracle I was able to put a diaper and pajamas on him, but I was left in shock at how he could go from little boy to [pissed off demon] (intensity) in .05 
 - Sitting at home [crying] (parent sentiment) following my 2.5 year old sons largest [meltdown] (intensity) in ever. I’m talking repeated [bites] (intensity) with one that [drew blood] (intensity), [screaming] (intensity), [thrashing] (intensity), and [throwing objects] (intensity). All because I removed him from the Power Wheel he climbed in at Walmart
 - so far today my dd2 (22months) [refused] (tantrum reason) breakfast [shouting 'no'] (tantrum reason) repeatedly-placated her by taking her to the [park] (setting), where she crawled down the path to the playpark bit [screaming] (intensity) 'buggy' (her friend was pushing her dollies buggy at the time)friend duly handed over said buggy,my little treasure picked it up and threw it screaming 'no' 
 - My mom has told me to start taking his diaper off & [spanking him] (parent reaction) twice when he hits me but I‘m still [unsure] (parent sentiment) of how I feel about doing that. I would rather try other solutions first before taking that route.
 - Every morning he wakes up [whining] (intensity) and [crying] (intensity) in his crib, instead of talking and singing like he used to. I get him up, and he continues to whine and cry

 - We tell him we are going to take a break and grab a snack at the restaurant. We sit down and he goes into [full blown meltdown] (intensity) mode
 - Our daughter will have very [rageful] (intensity) tantrums that will last up to [half an hour] (length), with absolutely no way to pacify her.
 - [Anger] (intensity) management 
 - To have him use more words to [express his needs] (parent reaction)/what's rather than [throw himself] (intensity) on the ground [crying] (intensity) and becoming [impossible to console] (intensity)
